# Day 1 spotlight workshop

### Intros
* Communtiy group introduce what FAC is and show the video from the facebook
* Introduce the rules of spotlight (take pic of the poster at spotlight? can't find them online)
* Let students know what they will get if they attend all 3 sessions (a personal website, on the internet, and the resources they need to continue with their learning)
* Go round mentors and introduce selves
  * Name
  * Why did you join FAC/why do you like coding?
* Go round students to introduce selves
  * Name
  * Why they decided to come to the session/what they want out of it
* Let everyone know about pairing + why it's important
  * Helps us learn from eachother
  * All big projects involve teamwork so it's good to learn with that dynamic from the start
* Let everyone know about 20/20/20
  * Tell them we won't be doing actual 20 min intervals, but that it's good to try and do a bit of googling on your own before you ask a mentor

### Actual code stuff

* Get everyone to make a github account (warning in advanced about faff with authentication? Maybe next time we should get them to do this in advanced?)
* Create a myname.github.io repo
* Add a single index.html to the repo (all on the github website)
* Write a single line of text at the top of your index.html ('hello world' or s/t. If they want to use their names make sure it's first name only, privacy etc.)
* Go into the settings tab of the repo and publish it on github pages
* Copy the url and put it in the description of the repo so they can get to it easily
* Show them their website, it's on the internet! (They seemed to like seeing it somewhere other than the computer they made it on, so try showing them on your phone or something)
* Do a walkthrough of basic html elements (codepen was good for this)
  * header tags, and how they are used (i.e. only 1 h1 on a page etc)
  * p tags, and how they are used for text
  * img tags and how to set the src of them
* Get everyone to put a h1 tag, a p tag and an img tag on their github page, then go look at them (make sure they swap so both students in the pair have a repo).
* Launch the page and take a look!
* Get everyone to look at eachother's pages.
* This should take up the whole time!
