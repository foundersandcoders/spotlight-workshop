# Day 2 Spotlight workshop

### Intro to CSS
* Introduce what CSS is vs. html
  * Something along the lines of:
    * HTML is what puts things on the page and says what they are supposed to be, CSS is how you make them look how you want to look.
  * So you put words on the page with HTML and change how they look with CSS etc.
* We will be writing the CSS in a <style> tag in the head of the html file they started in the previous session (this is to avoid doing inline styling, and to avoid showing how to link files)
* Start with showing basics of changing color of text, background colours and sizes of images. do this on the element so ```css
p {
  color: red
}
h1 {
  color: blue
}
    ```
etc.
* Get them to do this on their page, make their Header and P tag different colours, and to resize their image a bit (maybe use px for this).
* Make sure everyone has done this and swapped over so both have done this on their own pages.
* Now, introduce the concept of classes, perhaps in this way.
  * Okay, so all of our P elements will be the same colour, if you make a new P element it will have the same colour as what you declared in your CSS.
  * What if you wanted more than one P tag, but different styles on each? This is where classes come into play!
  * Demonstrate how classes are used and demonstrate styling on different instances of the same element (eg. make 2 different p tags different colours).
* Get everyone to do this now, make sure they have 2 p elements in their HTML, assign a different class to each one, and then style them on that class.

I feel like this should take up the whole session, if not, get the students to do a bit of googling (with guidance from mentors) to see what other styling they can do on their page!
